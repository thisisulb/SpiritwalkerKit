## SPIRITWALKER v1.2
## a Character Kit for BGEE / BG2EE / EET

Spiritwalkers forge a divine connection with the natural and spiritual world just
like other Shamans do. While those others call on a great number of Lesser and Greater Spirits to
aid their cause, Spiritwalkers form a closer and more personal bond with a select few but powerful
Spirit Animals.  
When they call on those Spirit Animals during their Shamanic Dance they do not ask the Spirits to
fight for them directly. Instead they invite the Spirits into their own bodies to help them shapeshift
into the form of a Spirit Animal themselves.

**SHAMANIC DANCE:**  
Spiritwalkers can shapeshift into Spirit Animal Forms by performing a ritualistic dance. While
dancing, the Shaman takes a +4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use
items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. After one round of dancing the Shaman
will shapeshift into the form of the Spirit Animal he/she has previously attuned him/herself to by
using the Spirit Attunement Special Ability.

due to his/her semi-corporal form but can not benefit from Iron Skins and similar effects.

The Spiritwalker calls upon the powers of an Ancient Yak Spirit, the epitome of durability and
fortitude, and gains the following traits:  
Massive Size: While in Spirit Yak Form the Shaman is immune to a dragon's Wing Buffet and
similar knock-back effects but moves slower as normal and might not fit into or through small
spaces.

his/her thoughts become more animal like and his/her cleric spells inaccessible

**BOOMING ROAR:**  
The Spirit Yak emits a powerful, booming roar. All opponents in a 30' radius that hear the roar have
their sense of balance impaired, resulting in a -2 penalty to their THAC0 and a 50% reduced
movement rate for two rounds.  
Those that fail their Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon (with a -1 penalty for every 7 levels of the
Shaman, up to -4 at level 28) will also be deafened for two rounds with a 50% chance of spell
failure.  
None-living creatures and creatures who do not possess hearing organs, like elementals or slimes,
are immune to this ability.

and gains the following traits:  
Feline Predator: While in Spirit Tiger Form the Shaman moves faster than normal and has a 10%
increased Critical Hit Chance but suffers a penalty of -30% to his/her maximum Hit Points and -4 to
his/her AC.

spiritual body to restore his/her own health. The target takes 1d8 slashing damage plus additional 4
slashing damage for every three levels of the Shaman (up to 1d8+40 at level 30) while the Shaman
gains the same amount of Hit Points. (Hit Points gained this way can not exceed the Shaman's
maximum health however.)  
If the target fails a Saving Throw vs. Breath Weapon (-1 penalty for every 6 levels of the caster, up
to -5 at level 30) it will also be knocked down for one round.  
Even though this ability can hit opponents that require the most potent of magical weapons to be
